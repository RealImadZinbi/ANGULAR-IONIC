# Full Stack test 
 Technical test for La Bourse aux Livres Full Stack developer. In this test we are assessing the following : 
 
- Your ability to install a new environement within a limited time. In this case an Ionic Angular project.
- Your ability to understand the requirements 
- Your creativity and your development skills. 

 # Background info 

You will find on this repository, a copy of the main screen of La Bourse aux Livres' real app. 
The idea is to work on this main screen to test your skills. 
You might not be familiar with Ionic Framework, it's fine we understand. We will assess you on what you did even if you don't finish the test.   

 # Todo:
 1) Clone and run the project on your machine (npm install & ionic serve)
 2) Add the "amount earned" and "paper saved" mock counter as described on the screenshot bellow (content in red) on the /tab1 page. 
 
 You are free to style it as you like. The counter should generate mock numbers and refreash on a regular basis (eg. every second)

 3) Bonus : Install the native cordova plugin : https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-barcodescanner
 4) Bonus : Launch the barcode scanner when the user clicks on "Je scanne le code-barres" (same behavior as the real app)
 5) ZIP your project (without node modules) and send it to : dorian@labourseauxlivres.fr before 22/11/20220 18h (48h hours from now) along with your name.

 Good luck !
